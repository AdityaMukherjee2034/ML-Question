Thought process for approaching the problem:
1. Inspecting the dataset
2. Cleaning and processing the dataset: looking at the dataset, I realised that it needed to be cleaned of all the distractions such as punctuations, symbols, etc to make it more easy for the model.So we defined a function for it.
3.In order to filter out articles containing items related to our related topic i.e. Israel/Hamas war, we defined a list of most common keywords concerning our topic and filtered out articles that do not contain these. 
4. after filtering we cleaning the articles through our cleaning function.
5. After all these pre=processing we defined a function to generate inputs for our llm model(we used a flan T5 model for this task) in a certain input format.
6. Finally we created our generate answer function, that would take the question and context as input and generate answer accordingly.
7. Finally we combined all the article bodies to make the context, and deployed the generate answer function to get our answer to the mentioned question.
